## üìã **Pre-Challenge Screening Questions (15 minutes)**

### **1. Concurrency & Data Consistency**
- "How would you handle a scenario where 1000 users try to reserve the last available seat simultaneously?"
- "Explain the difference between optimistic and pessimistic locking. When would you use each?"
- "How do you ensure data consistency in a distributed system without strong consistency?"

### **2. Database Design & Architecture**
- "Walk me through your decision process for choosing between SQL and NoSQL for a subscription system."
- "How would you design a database schema for a multi-tenant subscription platform with 1M+ users?"
- "What are the trade-offs between microservices and monoliths for this type of system?"

### **3. Scalability & Performance**
- "How would you scale this system to handle 100K concurrent users?"
- "Explain read/write separation strategies and when to implement them."
- "What caching strategies would you implement and at which layers?"

## üîç **During Challenge Technical Questions (30 minutes)**

### **Phase 1: Implementation Review (10 minutes)**

**When reviewing their code, ask:**

#### **Concurrency Handling**
- "I see you're creating a subscription. What happens if two users try to subscribe to the same product simultaneously?"
- "How would you prevent double-charging a user if the payment webhook arrives twice?"
- "Show me how you would implement seat reservation with proper locking."

#### **Database Design**
- "Why did you choose this specific schema design?"
- "How would you handle a scenario where a product becomes unavailable after a user starts the subscription process?"
- "What indexes would you add to optimize query performance?"

### **Phase 2: Edge Cases & Error Handling (10 minutes)**

#### **Payment Flow & Orchestration**
- "The payment webhook failed. How do you ensure the subscription is eventually created?"
- "A user's payment succeeded but our system crashed before creating the subscription. How do you handle this?"
- "How would you implement idempotency for payment processing?"

#### **System Resilience**
- "What happens if the database is temporarily unavailable during a subscription creation?"
- "How would you handle partial failures in a multi-step subscription process?"
- "Describe your retry strategy for external API calls."

### **Phase 3: Scalability & Architecture (10 minutes)**

#### **System Design**
- "How would you redesign this system for 1M+ users?"
- "Where would you implement caching and what would you cache?"
- "How would you handle database sharding for user data?"

#### **Monitoring & Observability**
- "How would you monitor the health of this subscription system?"
- "What metrics would you track to ensure system reliability?"
- "How would you debug a performance issue affecting 10% of users?"

## üéØ **Specific Technical Challenges to Present**

### **Challenge 1: Concurrency Test**
```typescript
// Present this scenario:
// "Implement a function that reserves the last available seat
// ensuring only one user can get it, even with 1000 concurrent requests"

async reserveLastSeat(userId: string): Promise<ReservationResult> {
  // Candidate must implement proper locking mechanism
  // Test with concurrent requests to verify correctness
}
```

### **Challenge 2: Payment Webhook Handling**
```typescript
// "Design a webhook handler that processes payment confirmations
// with proper idempotency and retry logic"

@Post('/webhooks/payment')
async handlePaymentWebhook(@Body() webhook: PaymentWebhook) {
  // Must handle:
  // - Duplicate webhooks
  // - Failed processing
  // - Retry logic
  // - Eventual consistency
}
```

### **Challenge 3: Scalability Design**
```typescript
// "Design a notification system that can handle 100K+ users
// with guaranteed delivery and proper error handling"

class NotificationService {
  // Must consider:
  // - Message queuing
  // - Retry mechanisms
  // - Dead letter queues
  // - Rate limiting
}
```

// Expected approach for seat reservation
async reserveSeat(seatId: string, userId: string) {
  const session = await mongoose.startSession();
  session.startTransaction();
  
  try {
    const seat = await Seat.findById(seatId).session(session);
    if (!seat.available) {
      throw new ConflictException('Seat not available');
    }
    
    await Seat.findByIdAndUpdate(seatId, { 
      available: false, 
      reservedBy: userId 
    }).session(session);

```typescript
// Expected approach for idempotent webhook handling
@Post('/webhooks/payment')
async handlePaymentWebhook(@Body() webhook: PaymentWebhook) {
  const idempotencyKey = webhook.idempotencyKey;
  
  // Check if already processed
  const existing = await PaymentLog.findOne({ idempotencyKey });
  if (existing) {
    return { status: 'already_processed', id: existing._id };
  }
  
  // Process with retry logic
  return await this.processPaymentWithRetry(webhook, idempotencyKey);
